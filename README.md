 
## Hi there – I'm Kelsey Cooper👋

I am a graduate student at Indiana University's O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs studying Public Affairs. I am specializing in systems analysis, integration, and regulation, with a specific focus on the environmental sector. 🌎  

I've led projects in the federal sector for the United States Geological Survey, NASA, and most recently the U.S. Department of Defense. 

🍁 My work with USGS will be published soon and analyzes the impacts of climate change on species in our national parks.🍁

Internationally, I have developed a new technology business process for the Netherlands Ministry of Justice and Security and have analyzed humanitarian data fror UNAIDS through Arqaam, a global monitoring and evaluation company based in Germany. 

In the private sector, I have worked as a technology strategy analyst for the Office of the CIO at a biotechnology company, where I led M&A efforts through Japan's largest aquisition of a company to date.
