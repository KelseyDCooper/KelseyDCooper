 
## Hi there – I'm Kelsey Cooper👋


I've led projects in the federal sector for the United States Geological Survey, NASA, and most recently the U.S. Department of Defense. Internationally, I have developed a new technology business process for the Netherlands Ministry of Justice and Security and have analyzed humanitarian data for UN Habitat through [Arqaam](https://www.arqaam.org/), a global monitoring and evaluation company based in Germany. 

In the private sector, I have worked as a technology strategy analyst for the Office of the CIO at a biotechnology company, where I led M&A efforts through Japan's largest foreign acquisition to date.
